# Simple Quantum RNG Repo

Welcome to the Simple Quantum RNG repo! This repository contains a simple code snippet demonstrating the generation of truly random numbers using quantum computing techniques.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find a Python script that showcases how to generate random numbers using quantum principles. 

The code utilizes IBM's quantum computing capabilities (or the quantum simulator) to demonstrate the power of quantum random number generators (RNGs).

## Getting Started

To run the code snippet, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the script `simple_QRNG.py`.

## Usage

Once the script is executed, it will generate random 0s or 1s integers using a quantum computer or a quantum simulator. 

You'll be able to experience firsthand the unique randomness achieved through quantum principles.
